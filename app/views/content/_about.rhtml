<h1><EM><STRONG>Questions?</STRONG></EM></h1>

<ul>
<li>Who can Join? Anybody, no you do not need to be a UBC student, no you do not need to know how to surf, yes you can join if you are a kyaker (spelling? i dont care), yes you can join if you are an alcoholic, what else? pretty much everybody can join, we try not to discriminate.</li>
<li>Does it cost money to join? Yup, membership fees very from year to year but itll probably be something like $20-$25 for UBC students and $30 for non UBC students (AMS requries we charge more to non UBC students).</li>

<li>I want a surfboard, where should I look? Like all things in life they can be purchased via craigslist</li>
<li>hmmm....</li>

Finding your way to the surf club office is tricky. It's in room 115 in the SUB, but this doesn't help anyone find it. Below is a crude map of the SUB and the location of the surf club office. To get there, go to the north end of the SUB and walk beside it towards the SRC (this would be towards the left on the map). You will pass the caf doors first, and then a pair of mysterious looking doors right after the caf. Go through these doors, and find the surf club office a short distance inside. If you are daring, exit through the east side of of the SUB after dropping by the club office.
